INTRODUCTION ʺEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Nelson Mandela According to UNESCO, ‘education is a powerful tool by which economically and socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty and participate fully as citizens’1. In pursuance of this objective, India has been offering scholarships to its Post‐Matriculation/Post ‐Secondary students, starting in 1948 with those belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and eventually extending the coverage to backward classes, disabled, minorities and the economically backward classes over the years. Today, through the three Ministries of Government of India, namely, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (covering scheduled castes, backward classes, disabled and economically backward classes), the Ministry of Tribal Welfare (covering scheduled Tribes) and the Ministry of Minority Welfare (covering Minorities), financial assistance is provided to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations to implement the Pre‐Matric and Post‐Matric Scholarships as a set of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.

The format for this documentation has been prescribed by the Department of Administrative reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India. Accordingly the documentation of ePASS is presented in seven sections, namely, 1. Situation before the intervention, 2. key challenges faced by innovators, 3. strategy adopted, 4. results, 5. sustainability, 6. key lessons learnt and, 7. replicability. This documentation has been done after a detailed primary and secondary research. Primary research involved consultation with key stakeholders of ePASS such as Students, Welfare Officers and the ePASS Service Providers – the Project team at Centre for Good Governance. Primary research also involved obtaining access to the ePASS website using login credentials and testing different services on‐line. As part of the secondary research, previous documentation on ePASS was referred to. The list of these references is given in the bibliography. ePASS website (http:/epa"}

SITUATION BEFORE THE INTERVENTION Recognising the importance of scholarship as a welfare measure for students from identified categories, Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) issued a comprehensive order in 20026, even before the introduction of online disbursal system, which outlined the detailed procedure to ensure timely scholarships to genuine students. It evolved procedures to plug the loop holes in the then existing process and methods to streamline the sanction, drawal and disbursement of Scholarships. The procedure followed for scholarship disbursement prior to the introduction of ePASS is briefly discussed below: a. Manual process for scholarship disbursement Notification is given at the start of academic year subsequent to which Colleges collect the application forms from district/field offices for distribution among students. Students fill out applications and submit them to the college along with required documents. College sends all applications along with attendance statements to the district office. These applications are then reviewed by the field officer who conducts field inspections to authenticate the details provided in the applications. The field inspector consolidates his findings and sends it to the district officer. The District Welfare Officer (D"}

Calculation of fees and other emoluments is done for each case and an institution ‐wise list is sent to the treasury with the proceedings.

The DWO revalidates UCs, checks dual claims and recovers amounts where necessary. b. Key Issues in manual process The manual process of scholarship application and disbursement were riddled with many problems. Some of them are discussed below:  The manual application and disbursement cycle was cumbersome and time consuming. It required all involved parties to make multiple physical visits to different offices and encounter delays at every stage.  Due to huge staff requirements for manual processing, scholarship applications were kept pending for years and arrears of scholarship payments were getting accumulated for years. Needy students joining institutions in the hope of availing scholarship often dropped out of their courses or completed their courses with huge financial burden.  Absence of mechanisms for systematic monitoring of transactions meant that there existed little scope for transparency or accountability in transactions. For instance, colleges who received cheques on behalf of students, in some reported cases, often colluded with department officials to misappropriate the maintenance fees payable to students. Existence of fictitious colleges, ghost students and duplicate claimants meant embezzlement of large schola"}

Existence of fictitious colleges, ghost students and duplicate claimants meant embezzlement of large scholarship amounts, leading to genuine students losing out on scholarship support. c. Efforts towards a new system Information Technology & Communications (IT&C) Department, GoAP initiated a programme called ‘Social Benefit Management System’ (SBMS) covering all schemes of all welfare departments. Sanction and disbursement of post‐matric scholarships was one of the modules of this system which was implemented on a pilot basis in Nalgonda District by Tribal Welfare Department and was implemented successfully during 2007‐ 08. Drawing from the experience of the pilot project, it was proposed to extend the package to other welfare departments and to scale it up across the State. In the workshop held in April 2008 in the State Administrative Training Institute, it was recommended to implement the package in Social Welfare, Tribal Welfare, BC Welfare and Disabled"}

The magnitude of disbursement and the accumulation of arrears of Rs. 2183 crores of 2009‐10, coupled with the demand of 2010‐11 only highlighted the urgent need to evolve a student centred solution which will build the much needed confidence among the stakeholders and confirm the seriousness of the Government’s commitment to welfare. In 2008, ePASS, the online scholarship system was launched through a Government Order (G.O.Ms.No.143 Social Welfare (Edn.2) Department dt:15‐07 ‐2008) giving detailed instructions covering the entire gamut of post‐matric scholarship process in the State and introducing the online application procedure for scholarship. 3. KEY CHALLENGES FACED BY THE INNOVATORS a. Large student database and duplicate entries: Centralised and electronic disbursement of scholarships, previously handled by multiple departments, requires the compilation of large and fragmented student data bases and weeding out duplicate entries. While the student database was already created by SBMS which preceded ePASS, large number of erroneous/duplicate/fake entries had to be eliminated. Records of close to 15 lakh students (in the initial stage; close to 28 lakhs today) spread across 10944 college"}

Records of close to 15 lakh students (in the initial stage; close to 28 lakhs today) spread across 10944 colleges (close to 13600 today) and handled by four departments (one more was added later) had to be examined for weeding out ineligible entries. It was therefore decided to use a unique ID as entry for registrations which will act as the primary key to identify each student record. The Senior School Certificate (SSC) ID of the students is currently being used as the unique ID. Over the years, the ID has helped weed out duplicate/ double claims and has brought substantial financial savings for the Departments. Efforts are being made to make the database Aadhar‐compliant by linking the SSC ID with Aadhar numbers of students. b. Population of Course Fee structure: As ePASS aimed to create a transparent application and payment system, providing the course fee structure of all participating colleges was a key requirement. More than one lakh entries had to be made across colleges and their courses. This was achieved by giving facility to"}

Informing the changed application procedures to student community: Familiarising the students with the new system was a major challenge for the success of the initiative. In order to address this issue, the Joint Director (Social Welfare)/Deputy Director (Social Welfare)/Project Director, Women Development & Child Welfare/ District Tribal Welfare Officer/District Backward Classes Welfare Officer/ Assistant Director, Welfare of Disabled and Senior Citizens were made responsible for giving wide publicity about the procedure for sanction of Post‐ Matric Scholarships online every year at least one month before the beginning of the Academic Year. The communication campaign focuses on facilitating the students to apply online for the Fresh/ Renewals scholarships and opening of savings bank account by the students in any branch belonging to any of the five nodal banks. d. Overcoming the resistance from staff: The introduction of the new system generated resistance from several stakeholders, primarily officials, due to the difficulties involved in shifting to a new and unfamiliar system and the vested interests associated with the opaque manual system. Efforts were made to minimize the resistance by f"}

Efforts were made to minimize the resistance by frequent capacity building workshops and personal interactions. Political will and bureaucratic commitment acted as key enablers for ushering in smooth change. The compulsion of going through the automated workflows during implementation without scope for any manual overrides also became a major factor for psychological acceptance of the project. During each monthly video conference, the enhancements and version changes are explained and doubts cleared. Workshops are held once in 2 months to discuss required changes. Officials can send queries or doubts through email or SMS to the help desk at PMU which replies to them and escalates unresolved issues to higher levels. 4. STRATEGY ADOPTED The strategy adopted for the implementation of ePASS is examined below through discussion of following dimensions: a) ePASS institutional structure b) ePASS modules and process flow and c) Monitoring, review and evaluation."}

Welfare Departments: Five welfare departments of the Government of Andhra Pradesh namely, Social Welfare, BC Welfare (includes Economically Backward Classes), Tribal Welfare, Disabled Welfare, and Minorities Welfare departments handle identification, verification of beneficiaries, authorisation of payments and administration of the project.  Nodal authority : Social welfare department has been designated7 as the nodal authority for issuing of Government Orders (G.Os) on the subject of Post‐Matric Scholarships in respect of all welfare departments. This ensures that respective welfare departments do not issue different instructions on the same issues of Post Matric Scholarships leading to unnecessary duplication of Government efforts.  Verification officers : Starting with around 400 field officers of welfare departments in 2008, the scholarship verification system now operates through close to 2361 verification officers who conduct online and physical verification of 7 G.O.Ms.No. 3 (Social Welfare "}

Documentary evidence of recognition of courses and number of seats granted to colleges by the relevant authority and details of bank accounts are filled in. Registrations of colleges are confirmed by the Deputy Director or Joint Director, Social Welfare after physical verification and cross‐ checking of documents.

First, by linking the application to SSC database, the system ensures that data entry requirements are minimised and student details are cross checked with the SSC database. Next, ePASS has linked up with Mee Seva11 for accessing student’s caste certificates and income certificates. This means that when a student enters his Mee Seva reference number for each of these certificates, ePASS fetches these certificates from the Mee Seva database thereby saving the time spent in scanning documents and the cost incurred in stationery. This also minimises the possibility of forgery as certificates have digital signatures. iv. Department module: The department module is the most crucial module of all and provides the following facilities:  Verification of students : The verification and forwarding facility has logins for verification officers, field officers and DWOs. Each verification officer’s account is automatically populated with a list of assigned colleges and list of students12 registered within the college for scholarship. Following are the key steps involved: o Physical Verification : Verification officers conduct physical verification of colleges as per date‐wise, college‐wise schedule drawn up by the District Collectors."}

Management Information System (MIS): ePASS provides for excellent MIS reports. It generates all transaction ‐based reports, helping officials to closely monitor the program and take informed decisions. v. Efficiency: Efficiency of the entire scholarship cycle is ensured through inbuilt validations of applications which prevent submission of an application unless all parameters are fulfilled, transaction ‐based reports, seamless exchange of information among departments and standardisation of procedures and rules for applying for a scholarship across departments. Further, ePASS has reduced transaction costs for all departments as the system is operated through a central server and inter‐linkage with other department servers for verification and validation of data. vi. Accountability: Time lines for each stage of processing are set and strictly monitored. Alerts in the individual logins and exception reports to higher officials help in streamlining the administration. As the activities of Departments and Colleges are easily monitored, instances of corruption have come down drastically. vii.

SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability of an eGovernance initiative has been defined as the retaining and using of eGovernment system with no intention by government organisations and people to abandon it and return to the manual system . Following are the key factors that contribute to the sustainability of the ePASS system: a. Criticality of the service: Scholarship disbursement is one of the most budget and labour intensive works of all welfare departments influencing the future of close to 30 lakhs students who constitute about 80% of the State’s post‐matric student population. Quality of scholarship administration therefore has a high degree of citizen interface and thereby, has significant implications for citizen’s satisfaction with government. By ensuring efficient, transparent and accountable administration of the scholarship process, ePASS caters to a crucial requirement of the welfare departments as well as those sections of students that are in need of financial assistance for accomplishing their academic pursuits. b. Organisational changes: Any system which brings about a well thought change in its organisational structure, culture, practices and employees’ skill sets stands a good chance for long term sustenance. Through a set of close to 300 G.Os, Memos and Circulars, substantial changes have been bro"}

Through a set of close to 300 G.Os, Memos and Circulars, substantial changes have been brought about in the way the welfare departments administer the scholarship system. Every related process of these departments has been modified to make them amenable to the ePASS workflow. All officers of these departments dealing with scholarships are required to perform their scholarship related activities through ePASS and undergo regular capacity building sessions on ePASS . c. Inter‐linkages : One of the key factors contributing to the efficiency and sustainability of ePASS is the set of inter‐linkages it has created with a series of databases to leverage their benefits. The most important linkage has been achieved with the treasury system which has enabled mass bill sanctioning and transfers of payments, making ePASS probably the first initiative to achieve this linkage. ePASS is linked with the Mee Seva data base for accessing caste and income certificates of students, with the Board of Intermediate education"}

Funding model: ePASS has financial backing in terms of a provision in regular Government budget and the payment for service provider (CGG) is based on number of transactions processed. The funding of ePASS is made from the Scholarship Head of Account. ePASS does not have a revenue model as the students are not charged for the services provided through it. However, the implementation of ePASS has saved resources to the tune of several crores for the government by weeding out fake entries, saving on stationery, minimising staff requirements and time in scholarship processing and eliminating opportunities for corruption. For instance, the weeding out of duplicate and fake entries itself saved close to Rs. 50 crores for the Government. For the students, colleges and departmental officials, ePASS saves substantial time and effort. e. Security & Strategy for disaster recovery and continuity: ePASS data is stored in CGG data centre with strict adherence to firewall security and other data centre security measures.

Continuous improvements : ePASS has made efforts to constantly improve upon its achievements and make course corrections based on feedback from its stakeholders. To keep itself abreast of the latest technological changes, it has planned a series of initiatives which include introduction of digital signatures, mobile governance (SMS alerts, SMS based tracking, etc.), data‐warehousing for digital dashboard and business analytics, etc. g. Duration of operation : ePASS has been operational since 2008 and has reported a consistent increase in the number of students, departments, colleges, universities, and banks utilising its services. 7.

The stream of G.O.s, memos and circulars which give detailed instructions for course corrections at every stage since 2008 are an evidence of the same."}

Payment of scholarship amount to students: There is no easy way: Large scale discrepancies in disbursal of scholarship amounts to students was one of the key reasons for introduction of ePASS. In view of the collusion observed between colleges and departmental officials in embezzling the money meant for students, ePASS started with a system where each student was required to open a bank account in one of the five identified nodal banks. However, it was soon realised that banks were reluctant to open zero balance/no ‐frills accounts for students from low income categories as these were essentially non‐remunerative. Therefore, it was decided to issue eZpay cards through SBI to students to enable drawal of monthly amounts through ATMs without opening of bank accounts13. While some of these cards were distributed through ‘distribution melas’ or distributed by the District coordinator of the Bank during verification of students by field officers, eventually it was observed that large number of these cards were being hoarded by colleges with the connivance of officials and used for embezzlement of student funds. It was therefore decided to discontinue the issue of new eZpay cards. Today, the responsibility for opening"}

It was therefore decided to discontinue the issue of new eZpay cards. Today, the responsibility for opening bank accounts lies with the students. Registration for scholarships cannot be completed without valid accounts provided by students. While this means some burden on the students, it minimises the possibility of large scale fraud by colleges. b. Student data: Student is the custodian : Few years into the operation of ePASS, it was noticed that some college authorities and departmental officials resorted to changes in the students’ database without their knowledge. To retain the integrity of student data, student login was provided, whereby only students are permitted to carry out any change in their application forms making students fully responsible for their application. c. Verification of students : Innovation helps : At the start of the project, the responsibility for verification was assigned to close to 400 field officers of the welfare departments. Over time, it was realised that 400 officers cannot handle the verification responsibilities of 28 lakh students spread across 13000 colleges. Hence in 2011, all district collectors were directed to identify verification officers for each 13 Bank was not required to create any ATM cards or follow the mandatory Know‐Your‐ Customer "}

Today, the number of verification officers range between 2000‐ 4000 depending on the workload and availability of officers. d. Grievance system: Feedback is crucial : While ePASS claimed to be a transparent system, it was operated without a formal grievance redress mechanism for almost four years. This had caused major inconvenience for students, colleges and officials since they had to physically visit PMU based in Hyderabad to sort out several issues. However, starting 2012, ePASS has introduced an online grievance redress facility to deal with grievances of students and colleges. However, many students are still unaware of the grievance system and continue to depend on their respective colleges to sort out several issues. This could lead to problems if colleges decide to exploit the dependency of students as has happened earlier. e. Impact of the system: Efficient need not mean effective : The major aim of implementing ePASS was not only to ensure that scholarships reached the right beneficiaries but also reached them at the right time. However, the scholarship administration system still faces major bottlenecks at following stages: i. Student and college‐oriented delays: Students often change colleges and courses "}

However, the scholarship administration system still faces major bottlenecks at following stages: i. Student and college‐oriented delays: Students often change colleges and courses without updating these details in ePASS. Sometimes, they lose their eZpay cards or keep their bank passbooks inactive for more than six months leading to invalidation of pass books. Sorting out such issues require repeated visits to District Welfare Offices as students cannot approach the banks directly for making these changes. On the other hand, colleges often delay the uploading the relevant details into the system leading to cascading delays. ii. Physical verification stage : The physical verification of students by verification officers could get delayed if a student for some reason is found unavailable during the day of verification. Moreover, as the verification officers may belong to any department, the Welfare Office has least control over them. Although the government instructions stipulate that colleges need to be informed one week in advance about the schedule of visits, delays on this account still persists. iii. Hard copy verification stage : Regardless of ePASS, hard copies of all applications are to be verified by the District Welfare Officer before issuing sanctions. The major delay at this stage arises on account of staff shortage. A single district may be require"}

Release of budget: The most important concern about the functioning of ePASS arises from the delay in release of budget from the Central and State governments. As a result, scholarship processing which should ideally take a mere few days through ePASS still takes several months depending on the availability of funds. This limitation is indicative of a more fundamental and general problem faced by several eGovernance initiatives across the country where systemic deficiencies cripple an otherwise efficient system. 8. REPLICABILITY ePASS as an effective model mechanism of scholarship disbursement has gained national recognition and is being replicated in five other States. Following are the key points to be considered in relation to replication of ePASS: a. Open source technology : ePASS is a simple and easy to use application developed using open source technologies and tools including PostGreSQL Database, Java Programming Platform, Tomcat web server, and Linux Server operating system. b. Level of customization : ePASS is not a generic application which means that it is not a product which can be replicated easily in a new setting. In replicating ePASS in a different setting, the application needs to be built from the scratch and completely customized to the requirements of the user. However, with some modif"}

In replicating ePASS in a different setting, the application needs to be built from the scratch and completely customized to the requirements of the user. However, with some modifications, ePASS can be used for pre‐matric, merit cum means, other scholarship schemes and other similar educational schemes in any State of India. c. Unicode compatibility : ePASS is not Unicode compatible and hence cannot support local language based applications. However, efforts are now being made to customise the website in Telugu language and other local languages. d. Peak load: ePASS has tremendous potential for scaling up as the ePASS server can handle a peak time load of 1.5 lakh applications in a day. Upto 80000 sessions have been handled at a time. As recognition to its potential, ePASS has been selected under the Rapid Replication Roll‐out initiative14 of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, 14 The Rapid Replication Roll‐out Initiative comprises of selection of some of the successful applications of one State and replicating them in other States that are willing to adopt them with customisation as per the Seeker States requirements."}

State Governments of Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Tripura are currently replicating ePASS under this initiative. It is expected that ePASS will be replicated by more States in the coming days. Conclusion: ePASS is a carefully planned and well‐executed innovation that strives to achieve continuous improvements through mid‐course corrections. However, the stability and long‐term sustainability of ePASS depends not only on the project leadership or the quality of the application but also on the support from crucial external elements such as the timely release of scholarship budgets. It is hoped that the Government of Andhra Pradesh as well as the governments in different States gearing up for replication of ePASS would keep in mind these challenges and take effective measures to address them. With the right political and administrative support, ePASS can become a truly powerful tool to take the benefits of education to disadvantaged sections and help them fulfil their aspirations. "}
